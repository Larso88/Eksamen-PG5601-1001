Known bugs:
There is just one fruit raining from the FruitDetail view. I tried to fix it with a ForEach on the amount of fruit
eaten from that spesifikk fruit. But for some reason the animation just never worked. 
The autoreverse on the animation does not do it`s job for some reason, so the 2. animation is the reverse animation.

On the date of the eaten fruit in fruit log i had some major issues with desplaying the date and time like I wanted,
and now I`m out of time
